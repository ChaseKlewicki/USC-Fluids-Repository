# USC-Fluids-Repository
Code repository for fluid mechanics related code.

All code should be submitted as functions and "beautified". Code must be thoroughly annotated. 

Each function must include:
1. A brief description of what the function does and how it does it.
2. A list of inputs and outputs describing the variable type and its dimensions.
3. The author of the function 
3. A section on related literature / code used to make the function
5. A section in the example script demonstrating how to use the function. 

To beautify a Matlab function: Ensure all code is within 76 col limit then select all (ctrl-A) and smart indent (ctrl-i)
To beautify a Python function: Adhere to PEP8. (Many autoformatting softwares exist... see Black, autopep8... etc)

To submit or improve a function:
1. Fork the repository 
2. Create a branch for the new code
3. Develop/edit function in branch
4. Ensure function meets above criteria
5. Submit pull request to master branch
